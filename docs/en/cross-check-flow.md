## Cross check
### Process

### Step # 1 Submitting your work for review

To do this, go to https://app.rs.school/ and click on the “Cross-Check: Submit” link. In the form, depending on the requirements of the task, you must specify either a link to a working and deployed site, or a link to a prepared pull request. The link can be submitted several times - the last one is saved. All who did not submit their work on time receive 0. The date of sending the work is indicated in the schedule.

### Step # 2. Steam generation
After the deadline for submitting works, pairs will be created to verify the task. Each student will need to check 4 other works.

### Step # 3 Checking each other’s work
All who sent work for verification - check each other's work. To do this, go to https://app.rs.school/ and follow the Cross-Check: Review link. How to check:

1.	Select a task (e.g. Portfolio)
2.	Choose a student
3.	After selecting a student, a link to the work should appear under his name. If the link is broken, please contact the student and ask him to resubmit the result.
4.	Check operation in accordance with the verification criteria specified in the task.
5.	Put a mark on the form.
6.	Leave a comment on why such an assessment was obtained.
7.	Submit a form.
8.	Each student checks 4 works.

### Step # 4 Getting Grades and Comments
-	The overall rating will be set as the average between 4 ratings and only if you have checked 4 other works.
-	If you checked all 4 works, but you don’t have a rating, then less than 2 people checked your work. At this stage, the main thing is not to panic and just wait.
### Appeal
-	only done if there are activists who are sorry to drive the process
-	only if the difference between the expected and the number of points you received is more than 15
-	works that have not been edited after the deadline are accepted for verification
-	the rating can be either lowered or increased without further discussion
### To file an appeal:

-	Create a new issue https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/support/issues. Call it by template: Cross-Check 'task name' - 'Your name on Github'
-	We fill in the issue according to the following template (if the issue is named or filled out incorrectly, it will not be processed):
        -	Link to your project deployment
        -	Link to the repository with the project on GitHub
        -	Evaluation as a result of self-examination, with its argumentation.
        -	Score for cross-check from your Score.

### The principle of performance assessment during cross-check verification
-	If you think that the item is made in full - set 100% the number of points.
-	If you think that there are serious deviations, and they are obviously not features, we set 50% of the number of points.
-	Item not completed at all - 0 points.
-	If the item implies a certain indivisible action, we set either 100% points or 0.
#### Example 1: make up a prototype that behaves correctly at any resolution

-	layout of application prototype adaptive or rubber - 20 points
-	if the layout behaves incorrectly at a resolution of 320px-1440px (in the case of adaptive layout, part of the data may be hidden at a resolution less than desktop) - 10 points
-	layout of the prototype application is not adaptive and not rubber - 0 points

#### Example 2: search for weather data by geographic location.

-	implemented search - 60 points
-	not updated map || forecast for today || 3 day forecast || coordinates - 30 points
-	search not implemented - 0 points
#### Example 3: implement the function of changing the background image

-	when refreshing the page, the background image changes - 10 points
-	when refreshing the page does not change the background image - 0 points

In the presence of uncritical inaccuracies - the assessment is put in favor of the student.

### Why cross-check?
#### Advantages
-	verification of all student work on time
-	100% understanding exactly how many students completed the task
-	95% of students check the work carefully. Responsible students leave valuable comments on the results of the audit.
-	great way to check layout tasks
-	cross-check allows you to compare your work with the work of other people, understand your level compared to others
-	the opportunity to see how different people approach the same task
-	job evaluation teaches you to read the terms of reference
-	students learn to check the work, which is especially important since many of them will return to RS School as mentors
-	the ability to look at the application from the user's point of view, to learn something new about their work, for example, behavior that they have not tested.
-	you read the requirements for the task more carefully when you know that another student will watch the work, be more responsible for its implementation
-	practical skills for testing applications that in the future can be used to debug your own projects
#### Disadvantages
-	job evaluation has not always been objective
-	the inability to contact the reviewing student, the inability to discuss controversial issues
-	not everyone was responsible for the verification. Someone wrote several lines and someone wrote several sheets.
-	verification takes a lot of time
-	clear assessment criteria needed
-	Course project
### Objectives of the second stage of training
-	Students gaining Core Js knowledge
-	Preparing students for technical interviews
-	English student submission
- Students completing a course project
